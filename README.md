This purpose of the repo is to demo a mock ecommerce store for the clothing label Pretty Green. The real website for the brand can be found [here.](https://www.prettygreen.com/)

A live demo of this repo can be found on heroku [here](https://pgmock.herokuapp.com/)

## The technology stack

The technology stack used is Javascript. React & JSX. The small item sample dataset was trivial enough to be able to create a simple ref object and consume it within the app without much in the way of performace considerations. That means at this stage there is no real ackend to the demo site.

The application demos the following features:

- Google Auth, traditional email sign up. These are managed using firebase.
- redux is used for state management.
- ReactComponent for SVG handling.
- Stripe CLI for faux payment gateway handling (sample card and details provided)
- Some components updated to use the Styled-Components library as a learning exercise.
