This purpose of the repo is to demo a mock ecommerce store for the clothing label Pretty Green. The real website for the brand can be found [here.](https://www.prettygreen.com/)

A live demo of this repo can be found on heroku [here](https://pgmock.herokuapp.com/)

## The technology stack

The technology stack used is Javascript. React & JSX. There is no real backend to the project. The small item sample was rivial enough to be able to create a simple ref object and consume it within the app without much in the way of performace considerations.

The application demos the following features:

- Google Auth, traditional email sign up. These are managed using firebase.
- redux is used for state management.
- ReactComponent for SVG handling.
- Stripe CLI for faux payment gateway handling (sample card and details provided)
